# Linking a website address 
- use brackets around an image ---> [img]
- then use another set of brackets to tag the var --> [sitelink]
- at the bottom of the markdown page you can add variables in a similar form to add an address that will link to your image --> [sitelink]: www.siteaddress.com


# Example
```

[image or whatever][sitelink]





[sitelink]: www.siteaddress.com

```

# Summary
- We can have an image link to a website when a user clicks on the image.
- We do that by creating a variable with brackets at the bottom of our mark down page.
- Then we surround our image with square brackets and square bracket the variable to the link we want to direct to.
