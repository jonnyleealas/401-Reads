# Play Framework
```
Play's architecture is RESTful by default. At it's core play is based on MVC pattern. Each entry point, paired with an HTTP verb, maps a Controller function. The Controller enables views to be web pages, JSON, XML, or just about anything else.

Play's stateless architecture enable horizontal scaling, ideal for serving many incoming requests without having to share resources(such as session) between them. It's at the forefront of Reactive programming trend, in which servers are event based and parallel processing is used to cater to the ever increasing demands of modern websites. 

In certain configurations, Play enables fully asynchronous and non-clocking IO throughout the entire application. The purpose is to reach new heights in terms of scalability on the web through efficient thread in terms of scalability on the web through efficient thread management and parallel processing, while avoiding the 'callback hell' that JavaScript-based solutions tend to engender.

Play also has an HTML template engine and all the tools needed to build fully fledged web applications, but we'll focus on the features needed to build an API.

Play was build for both SCALA AND JAVA users.
