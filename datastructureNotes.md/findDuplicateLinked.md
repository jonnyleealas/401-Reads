all these numbers live in nodes
what we want to find if there multiples 
use a hashtable?
on each node
have i seen it before yes or no 
if yes console log it and go to the next one
if no go next one


we have to create a list of unique values
make a hashtable
if no store in hashtable
stored will be a value of true
next
have i seen before if no store value of true
next
have i seen before if yes log out the value
next 
have i seen before no
store value of true

we use suplemental datastrucures
meaning we use another data structure to solve the problem


Removing a node
 always involves arrows
 we need to keep track of previous

 in a linked list we can use a while loop to iterate

 stacks and queues listen for the word process. or processing.

 trees are order, search, hierarchy 

 // Hash tables: 
//  // Key word: "Unique"

// Stacks and Queues: self destructive, 
//  // process

// Linked Lists
// // go through, iterate

// Trees or Graph
// hierarchy, order, Search

// Graph
// Relationship
