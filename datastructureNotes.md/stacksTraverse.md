# Stacks
- Are destructive

# Pass by reference
- passing stack into function 
- now the function has access to 

# Traversal of stacks and queue
- we have to pop and deystroy in order to view whats in a stack
- stack.pop() in order to view 
- enqueue to add to queue
- stack.peek() lets you view only the top of the stack.

# While vs Recursive
- in a while loop we use the loop while the condition exist
- in recursion we make a check , check some more things, run the function inside of its self. Then it does the process again: make a check, check some more things, run the function inside its self.
