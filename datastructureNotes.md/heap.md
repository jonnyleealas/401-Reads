# Binary Heap
- Its a tree structure
- Parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes
- Max binary heap is the oposite
- Left and right are smaller thane the parent
- Not ordreed like a binary search tree
- Binary search tree is not a Heap
-
# Max binary heap
- Each parent has at max two child nodes
- The val of eah parent node is always greater than its child nodes
- Max heap ther parent is grean than the childre, but there are no guarantees between sibling nodes.
- A binary heap is as compact as possible. All the children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first.
- Parent has children that are smaller but smaller arent necesarally the second largest numbers.
- Child must be smaller than parent but it is not ordered.

# Min
- Smallest node is the parent

# Representing Heaps
- Always fill the left child first
