# big o what is it?
- how do we know which ds is the correct for time and space.
- There are many approaches to solving problems. Big helps us find which one is best.
- Its a system of how to compare code based on time and space.
- Helps find the best solution.
- Helps discuss trade-offs between solutions.

# Takes time
- every operation takes memory
- an operation is as simple as a letter or number on the screen.

# Big o
- relationship of input size and time
- if n grows how does the time change
```
f(n) = function with an input of n

```

# linear
- As n scales the runtime scales
# quadratic
- As n grows the runtime is related to the square of n
```
f(n)= nË†2
```
# constant
- As n grows runtime stays the same
- when there is a definite limit to the number of operations its probably constant.
```
f(n)= 1
```
