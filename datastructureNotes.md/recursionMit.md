# Recursion 
- way of describing problems
- way of designing solutions(divide and conquer)
- made of two parts
- Smaller version of a big problem and using the small solutions to solve the big problem.

Base part: simplest part or direct answer. Also known as a stopping point. Every recursion problem must have a stopping point.
Inductive: How to reduce problem to simpler version. This is teh recursive.


# Palandrom Check
- We check whether the characters at the front and the end of the string match.
- next check inwards. 
- get rid of the spaces and make them lowercase
- check if the string of length 1 or 0
- take first and last character are they the same?

# Recursion
- Solving a problem by using a function and having it call itself.
- Recursion is a concept on how to solve problems by breaking a problem down into smaller problems.
