# Graphs
- Are node but in graph are called vertex
- linked list and trees are graphs
- LL are linear
- trees are hierarchical, parent to child
- react components are trees because they all point down.
- Graphs can point anywhere not just parent to child.
- Edges can point anywhere.
- Edges connect two nodes/verices together.

# Neighbors
- If  b, d, and ,c are all conected to a they are neighbors.
- If nodes are connected to edges they are call neighbors. However, to actually be neighbors they have to have edges that point to each other. If a point to c and c does not point to a c does not have a neighbor. A however has c as its neighbor do to its edge pointing to it.
- face book is an undirected graph: like a doubly linked list
- instagram is a directed graph

# Complete Graph or Commune
- Every node is connected by edges to one another. Looks like a kite.
- No start and no end. 
- Where we start becomes the root.
