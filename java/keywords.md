this = allows us to designate the difference between local variables and instance variables.
"this" can also be used to call methods when writing a class.

public and private = are used to define what parts of code have access to other classes, methods, constructors, and instance variables.

Encapsulation = used to keep implementation details hidden from other classes in order to create small bundles of logic.

Local Variables = Used within the scope they are defined in.


Static = means we are using the variable or method and applying it to the whole class. Static is of the class that it is in. 
The keyword "this" can't be used with a static method because static methods are not specific to an object, but the whole class.
Static methods and variables are associated with the whole class, not objects of the class.
Static methods and non-static methods can interact with static variables. 
void = means the method doesn't not return anything.
