# Arrays Random Facts
let theNewWord = ['ya', 'ba', '1234567', 'la'];

theNewWord[2][6];

the [2] gives us index 2 of the large array and [6] gives us the index of the characters of of index 2. 

theNewWord[2][6] would go to index two, then at index 2 it would look for index 6 and print the integer 7. 7 is the 6th index at index 2 of theNewWord.
