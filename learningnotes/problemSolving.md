A path and a plan is very important.
Do I understand the problem?
Once I understand the problem, how can I attack the problem?


Other things to note:
What do I need to learn in order to better understand the problem?
What do I need to learn to find better steps towards finding a solution?
How can I break the problem down into smaller pieces to help solve the problem in increments?
Start with the easiest solution and work my way down.
