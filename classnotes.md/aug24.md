# Nodes
Have value(data) and a pointer to the next node in the list.
Each node is a container that holds a value.
Nodes are objects with property and value.
A value and a next meaning the pointer to the next node.
At the end of the link list the next will be null. It is the end of the list also called tail.
The start is called head the end is called tail.
If link list . next equals to null. If link list . 
next equals truthy it means it the next node contains an object.
A value can also be a link list but thats another convo about hash map.
Next is not the value but the whole object.


# Big O Time complexity
O(n)
O of N
N means number of times i have to iterate in the worse case senerio 
O of 1 means you can go directly to the place to find and not have to go through each thing. O(1)
O(n2) means you have to go in a loop and then loop through another one. This is not efficient.


# Getting to previous nodes


# Data structures
1. when you are adding something to your link list. 
1. instantiate the item
1. check to see if there's nothing in the head
1. then add it to the head.
1. Algorithm means step by step.

# or Nations exlplination of data structures and algorithm 
1. first instantiate a linked LinkedLest( has no nodes -> empty "head")
1. next, append a node to our LinkedList
1. should check if any nodes already exist, if not, set our first node as the head node. 
1. this is an algorithm, meaning do this do this.

# Traverse through nodes
Jump to the next thing by assigning a current.
Important in relation to other DS.
1. How to find or look through it or traverse through a thing.
1. As were traversing the thing we're on we set it to the thing we are one.

### Learn how to traverse through things to find things. 
### learn how to find things in a link list.
