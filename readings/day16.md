#
Why is access control important?
```
We don't want just anybody authorized to view certain files, or have authority to delete.
```
# 
Describe an application that would need access control. 

```
Something like a bank app. We would need to restrict access to the majority of 
workers who may have access to personal client information.
```
#
What is a role used for?
```
A user is given a role and that role will have it's own set of privileges.
```
#
Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control? 
```
Roles have predetermined access privileges. If we need change access to a given user we simply change the role.
```
