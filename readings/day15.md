# Access Control (ACL)


When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?
Basic auth is user name and password. Bearer is the next step to security. Once basic auth is excepted a token is created. Bearer auth takes the token and verifies that it can be given access.
What does the JSON Web Token package do?
Generates tokens.
What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?
We should make sure that no one sees the secret by using dotenv. The secret doesn't have to be complicated.


## Vocabulary Terms
```
encryption: Information converted into a secret code.
token: A code given once a user is authenticated.
bearer: Take a token and authenticates the token to approve access.
secret: A JSON web token usually inside a dotenv for security.
JSON Web Token: Credentials that grant a user access to api requests and user data.
```

### Notes
- Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
I was able to understand how authorization wiring works a bit better. I'm starting to see patterns for debugging. I can now export separate functions without using a class.
- Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
1. I'd like to be able to build a full oauth crud api without looking at notes. 
1. React
1. Sass
- What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
I still suck at css so I'd like to do more of that to improve.
