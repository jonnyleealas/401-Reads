### Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?
```
A library is a collection of objects/functions/methods, Utilities, and classes. It's pre-written code we can use.
A framework can contain different libraries within it. It can also contain a collection of scripts. It defines a flow of control with an inversion
of control. Instead of a client asking making a request to the server the server asks the request of the client. Frameworks control the flow 
of an application where libraries do not.
