1. Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)
Used where only a single instance of a class is required to control the action throughout an execution. {geeksforgeeks.org}
1. Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes
We can create a single object to use with other objects without having to recreate that object multiple times. It allows us to uses one instance of an object through out different objects.

1. If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it? 
I would probably go through Npm to allow for package download. I would think of what types of middleware I need to create. Next I would think of which mkdir I need to create and which files I need to touch for organization. 
I would take the whiteboard approach and maybe draw out an outline of things I would need and the direction I need to take in creating the package. 

### Vocab
- Router Middleware: Middeware bound to instance of express.Router(). {expressjs.com}
- Dynamic Module Loading: Dynamic call a module only once vs static which call modules twice. 
- Singleton Pattern: A pattern that restricts an instantiation of a class to one single instance. {wiki}
- CRUD -> REST Method Matches: Crud is CREATE READ UPDATE DELETE -> REST: GET POST PUT DELETE
- Mock Testing: A method in jest used to test methods. Instead of using real life data like credit cards or make network requests. It fake data to be able to test certain methods.
