## Readings: Component Composition


### Can a parent component access the state of a child component?
```
We can do this by using a callback method that the child component triggers and pushes the state values upward. {linguinecode.com}


```
### What can be passed along in a prop variable?
```
Anything from variable, integers, objects, arrays.


```
### How can a child component “know” the state of another component?
```
The child cannot access the state of another component. But we can probably call a function from child through props.
We can add a method that handles updating the state to the parent component and pass the method as a prop to the child component instead of the state itself. {techiediaries.com}

### Term
- component props
```
Props is short for properties. React uses props to transfer data from one component to another.

```
- component state
```
Component stat is an instance of a react component. A realization of a react component.

```
- application state
```
Everything needed to keep an application running. State of the program as it exists in the contents of its memory.

```

### Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
```
- I feel like all these reads are helping us learn how to google. I think i've come to an ah ha moment and see why cf gives us so many read assignments.
- I kept seeing the word props and didn't know what its function was in a components constructor. I now know it is used to transfer data from one function to another.

```
### Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
```
States in programming are still a bit vague to me. 
React testing.
More buttons. 

```
### What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
```
I'd like to just have more time to study everything.
