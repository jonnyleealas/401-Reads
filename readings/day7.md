## Difference between PUT and PATCH.
PUT will update an entity if it exists, and create a new entity if it doesn't exist.
PATCH applies a partial update. User will only need to supply the data that needs to be update and the rest will remain unchanged.

## Mock api
1. postman
1. mockoon
1. nock

## (un)successful HTTP status codes
- Unsuccessful: Anything in the 400s
- Successful: Anything in the 200s.

## SOAP VS REST
- SOAP: Simple Object Access Protocol; Works with XML formats and is a protocol.
- REST: Representational State Transfer; Is an architectural pattern and allows a greater variety of data formats.

### Vocab
- SOAP: Simple Object Access Protocol
- REST Verbs: Get, PUT, POST, DELETE
- CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete
- Swagger: Is a tool used for REST API testing.

### Preview
1. I have a bit more clarity about middleware, express, and http codes. 
Middle ware is known as the glue between applications; Express is used for routing; and http codes 200 are for everything that is good while 400 are for everything that is bad.
1. I need to learn more about testing, api builds, and middleware.
1. I'd like to see if I can actually build an api.
