### Does a deployed React application require a server?
```
React does not need a static server. You could run it on AWS or Heroku.


```
### Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?
```
React is front end focused, therefore its more important to test behavioral(front end) rather than unit testing(backend).
```
### What does npm run build do?
```
It's a custom script command named build. We would need to assign commands to the build in order for build to do anything upon npm run.
```

### Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application
```
React is made of components. Components are functions or classes that are exported into a file that may require them for rendering. We can than build different components like lego block and require them in a file where we can build our legos. After we can do the same thing we do every night... try and take over the world. So in a nut shell that is react.
```


## Term
- BDD
```
Behavior Driven Development

```
- Acceptance Tests
```
End to end testing done by the customer that has requested a particular software to be build. Acceptance testing is how they test whether the software does what it is expected to do by the customer.

```
- mounting
```
Mounting refers to the first time react renders a component and builds the Dom.

```
- build
```
Creates a build of your react app. Instead of running Http requests for all of your application files build merges all you files together making your site quicker at load.

```

### Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
JSX is a bit more clear in how it uses functions that look like markdown. I know I'm late on the try catch thing, but I understand a bit more why a developer must use try catches to catch certain errors.
Lastly, I learned about babel. Bable is used as a type of translator for JS when using JSX. Like a dongle that lets JS read JSX syntax.
### Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
More react, css, this.props.

### What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
I'd like to see if I'll be able to build a react site at some point.
