# Big O/ O(n) Time complexity 
- O of N
- N means number of times we have to iterate in the worse case scenario. 
- O of 1 means we can go directly to the place without having to search through everything. O(1)

## Nodes 
Nodes have value(data) and a pointer to the next node in the list.
Each node is a container that holds a value. 
Nodes are objects with property and values.
The value points to the next node, but once at the end of the node list the next will point to node. The begging being the head and the end of the list being the tail.



# Linked List Data Structures and Algorithm 
- Algorithm means step by step
1. first instantiate a linked LinkedLest( has no nodes -> empty "head")
1. next, append a node to our LinkedList
1. should check if any nodes already exist, if not, set our first node as the head node. 
1. this is an algorithm, meaning do this do this.

# Traverse through nodes
Jump to the next thing by assigning a current.
Important in relation to other DS.
1. How to find or look through it or traverse through a thing.
1. As were traversing the thing we're on we set it to the thing we are one.
