- Child is stateless 
- App component is our main container
- Child points finger and asks parent to do something for them. Like dad can you reach that thing for me, I'm a child.
- Properties are passed down from parents to child.
- Events are passed down but triggered upwards.
- To pass from grandFather component to parent we can use the spread operator
- events happen inside the onClick
