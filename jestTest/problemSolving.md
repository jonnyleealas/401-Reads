# Understand 
- Make sure you understand the prolblem before trying to solve it.
- Come up with concrete examples to reword the problem. Explain the problem to a child.
- Come up with user stories with input and output.
- Unit test help too however I am not great at them at the moment.
- Restate the problem to understand.
- Then progress to more complex examples.
- Explore with invalid inputs.
- Explore examples with empty inputs.
- Explore edge cases or invalid inputs.

# Breaking down the problem
- Understand the problem
- Explore with concrete examples.
- Break it down
- Does that sound crazy to you? Do you think that will work?
- Allows for time to think about the code. 
- Allows for hashing out of lingering questions.
- Forces you to think about the code before you run without walking.
- Helps stay focused.
- Loop over every character in the string and do something.
```
Example of pseudo
    Make and object to retun
    loop over string
    return the object at end
```
- Alpha numeric characters are spaces and exclamation points or periods.
- In an interview it helps and demonstrates to the interview that you have formulated an approach to solve the problem when you write down pseudo code.
