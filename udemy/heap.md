# Binary Heaps
- Another category of tree, but different rules
- Min and max heaps
- Not ordered other than parent being larger or child being larger. 
- Used in priority queue --> importance level --> graph traversal

# Max Binary Heaps
- Parent nodes are always larger than child nodes.
- Children are smaller than parents.
- Parents have at most two nodes.
- Every left and right is filled before we move out.
- Highest at the top lowest at the bottom.

# Min Binary Heaps
- Parent nodes are smaller than child nodes.
- Children are larger than parents.
- Lowest at the top highest at the bottom.
