# Binary tree
- each node has a maximum of two
- can have one child or non
- two child nodes are names left or right.
- left children are always left than their parent
- right child is always greater than their  parent.

## Balanced
- left and right sub trees have roughley same amount of trees

## degenerate tree
- also known as a linked list.
- linked list is a type of tree
