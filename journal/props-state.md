# React components 
- Are classes or functions

# CallBacks
- Allow us to send functions into functions

# State and Props
- Ability to pass state and properties between components
# Parent and Child Components
- Parent pass down to children
- Children have siblings

# Children Components
- App component can have state
- Components withing app can have their own state.
```
    * Rules:
    - One way data flow
    - Info can go to your children and their siblings
    - App can share state to their children
    - Children cannot share with their siblings
    - This is called one way data flow
    If there was a component inside a child container child 1 can send state into child 2 that is inside.
```
