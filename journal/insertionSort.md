Checks an array and sort lowest to highest.
We shift numbers the the left till everything is sorted.
we check index 0. everything a number is greater than the number in index 0 that number will be shifted to the left till there arent number greater than index 0. Then we do the same for index 1. We keep doing this till everthing is sorted.
