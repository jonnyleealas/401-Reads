Today i learned about learning to listen more than I speak. Learned to avoid arguments. There is a way to communicate my thoughts and feelings without looking to win.

I also learned that if i am using a class in java i need to give it a data type. Since i am using a class the data type can be the class name.

When using intellij with java the app.config has a bunch of things that I can use to configure setting for the application. Cors or headers or just about anything. There are a bunch of settings to check out in the app.conf.

SBT clean cleans unused files. SBT reload reload. SBT run starts the server.

Everything in coding has a specific type or things or manner in which the data needs to be accepted or sent. That is half the battle, figuring out how the data needs to be sent so the the client can read the data.

Everything in java is an object. 

The backend used rest and the front end uses crude to use the rest methods in the back end. 

We connect the backend in our front end by giving it the backend url.

Our backend connects to the front end by setting accepted url to the url that is on the front end.

The front end model has to match the columns in our database. That is how id sends an id or name sends a name.

Today one of the issues we fixed was that we had java 15 not java 8. Installing things correctly is half the battle.
