# What information do I need?
# What information do I have that I don't need.
## Regular hashmaps are not iratable by nature but languages let you iterate.
    - Let something = new Map() is the build in hashmap to allow you to iterate a  hashtable.


We need the keys to match. What it was in the left what it was in the right.
## Edge Cases
Are input values that require special handling.

# Iterate
- Hashtable.forEach()

# go through the key
key is flavor value is value
does second contain[key] 
yes 
push value
if null
go to the next one

# Maps in JS
let words = new Maps()
