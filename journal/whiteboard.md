in a hash table, how does it actually work.
- Hash tables have keys and those keys have values. Those keys can be linked list.
- key would be the word.
- value would be the times that it has appeared.

- clarify exactly what they want so that you know what to input and what to output.
- ask questions.
- find the problem domain, the pseudo code, the diagram, the algorithm.

- write out your questions
- write out the problems
- find out what it returns
    - is it an array, integer, boolean?

When the interviewer asks a questions we need to debug our code.
Every data structure has a key word to look for 
- process means stack or a queue. 
- iterate means linked list
- find, search, means binary search tree
- unique, dictionary, locate means hashtable O(1) look ups.
- relationships means graphs

# useEffect 
- are event listeners on variables
