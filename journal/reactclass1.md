# React 
- Deals with components
- Deals with state

# Persistance 
- Database state 
- Real persistent 

# React State
- State of the page
- Page state knows everything that is typed
- A moment in time
- Context in which we live in the room
- Defines the shape of markup
- Changes the state of things
- Mark up reacts to state
- State is data inside of an object
- React binds that data
- Manages whats in data and bind that data to the front end.
- We change data and the front end changes
- Bind the state do the div
- the div changes our mark up through the bound state
- This component is tied to this state
- We tell which things to change when things change
- Change this, when this changes

# Virtual Dom
- React has an object called virtual dom
- React manages this behind the scenes
- I knows what to render through which variables
- Its the manager of things



# Phases
- What are the components; What things make up my app
- What data do I need to makes the things look right and present to the user
