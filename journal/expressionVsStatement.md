# Expression vs Statements
- Expressions are values. They don't cause anything to happen. They are just there and matter of fact.
    - If something is resolved to a value then it is an expression.
    - When assigning a variable js expects an expression not a statement.
- Statements act upon values or use values. They also create side-effects.
    - Statements are instructions and actions
        - If statements, for, while, else
        - An entire line of code that performs some actions.
