# Classes of functions
- O(1) = Constant --> f(n) = 2, f(n) = 5, f(n) = 5000.
- O(logn) = Logarithmic
- O(n) = Linear --> f(n) = 2n + 3, f(n) = 500n + 700, f(n) = n/5000 + 6.
- O(nˆ2) = Quadratic
- O(nˆ3) = Cubic
- O(2ˆn) = Exponential

# Variables 
- n --> numbers
- k --> known
- i --> index
- i j k are used in for loops because they are in ascending order in the alphabet.

# Summary
- Functions can be categorized based on their Time Complexity. Linear means its based on the input and the program visits each element in the input. Say we are looking for an element in an array and we don't know which index it is is. We would have to traverse the array till we find our element. That means the time it takes to find the element is dependant on how many things we have to traverse till we find our element. This is Linear.
- Constant means that regardless of the size of the input the cost of time does not change. Like accessing an element in a hash table. We simply go to the address of the element in the hash table and don't have to traverse through each element till we find what we are looking for. We simply search by using the key address of the element in the hash table.
    - Constant looks for a specific address in memory instead of traversing through all of memory to find an element.
