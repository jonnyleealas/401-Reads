# Intro
- First Design
    - Algorithms can sometime be written in design time first.
    - Starts with knowledge of domain. The people who are using the program may have the domain knowledge.
    - Programers also can have domain knowledge.
        - Design can be written in English or math. Math is better. It must be understandable.
    - Hardware and software are not dependant on the design. 
    - Analyze what your design.
- Then Program
    - After designing we can move to programming our program/ problem.
    - Must be written in a programming knowledge. 
    - When writing the program it is dependant on hardware and software.
    - Test the program.
