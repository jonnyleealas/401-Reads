# Divide and Conquer 
- Strategy for solving an algorithm.
- An approach or design for solving a problem.
- These are recursive in nature.
- We then combine all sub solutions to solve the main problem.

# Problems under divide and conquer
- Binary Search
- Finding Maximum and minimum
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Strassem's Matrix Multiplication

# Summary 
Break a large problem into sub small problems. If the small problems are too big break them into smaller sub problems.
