# Pretend you're worth $1000/hour
- Most people value their time at far less than it's worth.
We must learn to say no to things that waste our time. We shouldn't waste our talent, attention, and effort to people who are takers. If we allow it, the people around us can take up all of our time. We must not allow that. 
# 
Our lives are like a paycheck; we must set a budget. Being busy is not the same as being focused. Being busy just means you're using your time. That doensn't mean you are using your time wisely. We must be in charge of our time.

" People are unhappy in large part because they are confused about what is valuable." -William Irvine.
# 
Being busy can be a sign of laziness and lack of discipline, or too many unimportant tasks are taking away usefull time.
# 
Practice proper focus. With good focus we can accomplish more in less time. Letting distractions in take up more time and sway us from the results we are looking for. Saying yes to everything is an example of wavering focus. Learn to say no to most things. Choose carefully how your time is being used.
