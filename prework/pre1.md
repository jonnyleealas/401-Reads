## Problem Solving

We must take time when answering problems. We have time, but a common mistake is rushing to get to the answer. Don't get ahead of the problem and start writing code. Think about it. Let the problem settle in before you start writing code. Understand the problem as best as you can before moving forward with attempts to solve it.

# Simple Steps
1. Read it twice.
1. Solve it manually with 3 sets of sample data.
1. Optimize the manual steps. 
1. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
1. Replace psuedo code with real code.
1. Optimize the real code.

# 
70% of time should be used in the first 3 steps. Its ok to read the problem 3 or 4 times. Being able to explain the problem to someone else can show whether you understand the problem to begin with.

# 

Use at least 3 different inputs to make sure you understand the solution.
# 
Write things down so they are not held up in the brain. Things can get cluttered in the mind. Sometimes writing things down can help keep a clear head.
## Know Your Programming language
1. Create a list.
1. Sort a list or array.
1. Create a map or dictionary.
1. Loop through a list, or dictionary.
1. Parse Strings.
1. Convert from string to int, int to string.

# Divide and Conquer
Sometimes a problem will need multiple steps to solve. Find a way to cut the problem in half and solve a portion of it first before moving to the next portion of the problem.
