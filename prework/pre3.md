# Think Like A Programmer
" Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think." -Steve Jobs

# 
Programming teaches us how to solve a problem effectively. As programmers we are trying to solve problems in the best way possible. We are trying to be effective and also get out of our own way. We need to find clear ways of problem solving. We must use a frame work to problem solving and stick to it.
## Understand
Know what is being asked. Things are difficult when we don't understand what is being asked. Talk about it, write about it, doodle about it; use these things to decode a problems understanding.

" If you can't explain something in simple terms, you don't understand it." -Richard Feynman
# Plan
Write down the steps needed to find a solution. Give the brain time to analyze and process the information. " Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?"
# Divide 
It's ok to break up a big problem into smaller bits. This is called the "reduce the problem technique".
# Stuck?
Be curious not irritated. Look at it as a puzzle because puzzles are fun to solve.
- Debug by going back line by line and seeing if you missed anything.
- See what it is you told your program to do. After all, the computer will do what you tell it to do. You just have to figure how what to say to get it to do what you want.
- Take a step back and take a break. Restart your brain and think of another approach.
- It's ok to start over.
- Ask google. Ask online users. Someone has probably solved the problem you are trying to solve.
- Look for small solutions. You don't want all the answers. Struggle is good and it helps teach you. 
- Play games and learn to solve micro problems. Coding is about solving micro problems.
