# 5 whys and Hows
This is a technique that helps find the cause-effect relationship. It will help you find out why something is happening by asking why. " A tool for making clear the nature of the problem as well as its solution".-Taiichi Ohno. 
# 
The basic method involves asking why 5 times. It will help you get closer to a possible answer each time. 
# 
Ex: " I want a million dollars."
# 
1. Why do I want a million dollars? " Because I want to be rich".
1. Why do I want to be rich? "Because I can have enough money to quit my job so I can travel".
1. Why do I wanna quit my job and travel? " Because I want to see more new places and write about them".
1. Why do I want to see more new places and write about them? "Because I want to share my knowledge with other people".
1. Why do I want to share my knowledge with others? "Because it makes me feel fulfillment and happiness".

# 
The human mind doesn't do well with abstract or complex tasks. To avoid confusion we can use the why method. Breaking down our confusion piece by piece to help find our problem.

# 5 Hows
The 5 hows help us find a solution to our whys. 
1. I want to get better health. How? "I can start by going to a gym".
1. How will you go to a gym?
"I can sign up to a gym in my city".
1. How will I sign up to a gym in my city? "I can google a gym and sign up online".
1. How will you google and sign up online? "I can use my computer and make a search".
