# What is Cloud Computing
It is a network of servers that store and process our data.
Data center: Facility that stores thousands of servers.
We can store our data in the network servers instead of our hard drives. We can also run website on those servers instead of having to run our own server.

# Policies
This falls on the responsibility of the sysadmin.
Concerns computer security and allowing access to certain users.
Users should not be allowed to: Install software, view non-work related website(not always true), set their own password on company devices(must avoid someone else to view company emails). 
Always document policies, procedures.


# IT services Infrastructure
Services must be managed. 

# User hardware provisions
Sysadmins create new users and give them access to the companies resources. They also remove user if users leave the company. They are also responsible user machines. Make sure users can login and have necessary software.
Must also think about hardware lifecycle: how old is it, how long will it last, does it need an upgrade, does it need to be updated, retirement. 

Hardware lifecycle: Procurement(purchased hardware for an employee), Deployment(set up so employee can do their job), Maintenance(Where hardware is updated and issues are fixed if they occur), retirement(un-usable hardware needs to be removed).

# Routine maintenance 
Batch update(once a month or so we update all computer/ not always necessary).


# Vendors
Setting up printers, phone, desk phones.
Working with vendors and setting up business accounts for hardware supply or service supplies.

# Trouble Shooting
Sysadmins trouble shoot at a larger scale. 
Two skill needed: 
{
Trouble shooting, asking questions, isolating the problem, following cookie crumbs, reading logs.

Showing empathy, using the right tone of voice, dealing well with difficult situations.
}

Trouble shooting can be track through a ticketing system.

# Disasters
To avoid losing everything we must back up data for later recovery. Sysadmins are responsible for keeping data available.
