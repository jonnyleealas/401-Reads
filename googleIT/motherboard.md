Foundation that holds our computer together.
It allows for all components to comunicat with each other.

# chip set
How components talk to each other.
North bridge and South bridge
North: Ram and video cards
South: IO or input output controllers, hard drives or usb devices that output data.

# Peripherals
Outward components devices like mouses or keyboards

# Expansion slots
Give us the ability to increase the functionality of our computer.
Like upgrading graphics cards.

# Form Factor(sizes and amount of stuf we can put in it)
This is the size of our computer.

# Storage
Data sized: bit, byte, kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte, terabyte

# HDD vs Solid State
Hdd are spinning and more fragile
SSD is slimmer and less fragile. More expensive.
Hard drives connect to an interface. Either ata or sata. Nvme is a faster interface for hard drives.

# Power supply
DC(direct current) or AC(alternating current changes current)
Most power supply units have a fan attached.
Power supply converts ac to low voltage dc.

# voltage vs amps
amps pulls electricity and voltage gives you all the electricity.

## Knowing
Knowing how to diagnose power issues and replace a failed power supply is important in IT.

# Peripherals
Anything that you connect ot you computer that add functionality. {MB is megabyte; Mb is megabit; 1 byte is 8 bits}
