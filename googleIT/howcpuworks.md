# How do computers work
A computer stores and processes data by performing calculations. The more computing power you have access to the more you can accomplish.
Compares 1 and 0's a million times per second.
Binary is computer talk with 1's and 0's
We group binary into 8 numbers or bits. A bit is a binary digit. IN the early days cpu used the base 2 numeral system to move things around.
8 bits = a byte. 
base 2 ( 2Ë†8) Computers talk in binary.

# Character encoding
Bytes store only 0's or '1 and only 256 values.
Char encoding assigns values to binary values.

ASCI is the encoding standard for letter, digits, and punctuation.

UTF8 the most prevalent encoding standard used today. This allows storing characters in more than 1 byte.

RGB is used to store colors. 3 characters in each characters.

# Binary foundation
1 means on 
0 means off

# Logic Gates
Allow our transistors to do more complex tasks, like decide where to send electrical signals depending on logical conditions.

# How to count in binary
128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1 = 255 zero is counted as a value
0   0  0  0  1 0 1 0 
All of this in binary would equal 10. Only 8 and 2 are on which add up to 10.

# Abstraction
Take a complex system and simplify for our use.
Abstraction hides complexity by adding a common interface. We break computers down into simpler ideas that describes single concepts or jobs that need to be done.We then stack them in layers.
An error message is an abstraction. It has been abstracted out for us so we don't have to go look for the error ourselves. It makes our lives easier.
