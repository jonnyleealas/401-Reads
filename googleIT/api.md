# What is an API?
API means application programming interface.
It is an interface for queries to pre-written code. We ask the api and the api does the work. Its like a middle-man interface for code. It allows two applications to communicate with each other. 
An api is a set of functions that allows applications to access data and interact with external software. 
    - components
    - operating systems
    - microservers
An api delivers a user response to a system and sends the system's response back to the user.
