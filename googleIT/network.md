# What is the internet?
An interconnections of computer's around the world. The interconnections is called a network.
The internet the physical connections of computers and wired around the world.
The Web the data information on the internet.

# Networking
Managing, building, and designing networks. Its important in IT.
Large computers called servers connect to the internet, satellite and underground cables.
Servers store the sites we use. 
The websites serve content. 
The machines we use are called clients. 
Clients request the content. They don't connect to the internet. Actually they connect to a network provided by a service provider(ISP).
When we mail a letter we write our address and also the address where our letter is going. In networks we use our  Ip Address.
Computers on a network have IP address(110.3.4). When we access a website we are actually accessing their IP address.
Devices that connect to a network use a MAC address. MAC addy is used to ensure the physical address of a computer. An IP address is used to uniquely identify the connection of the network with that device take part in the network. 
Or mac address is a unique identifier that is assigned to a network interface controller/card. An ;ip address is ;an address ;that helps you tlo identify a netowrk connections.
Data sent through a network are called packets.

# Language of the internet
Network protocols: Routed efficiently, aren't corrupted, secure, right machine, named appropriately.
Transmission control protocol == deliver information from one network to another., internet protocol == IP.
The web: All websites are accessed through the web. 
URL: uniform resource locater.
domain: name of your website.
com,net,org: standard for what type of website it might be.
We can use the domain name or the IP address to access a website. All this is done by using DNS.
DNS: Takes the domain and matches it to the corresponding IP address. 

# Darpa 
The early version of the internet started by the government.

# TCPIP
Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet protocol


# NAT
Network address translation: Lets organizations use one public ip address and many private ip addresses within the network. 
IT support specialist may have to configure a router to facilitate communication between a companies network and the outside world.

# Globalization
The movement that lest governments businesses, and organizations comminate and integrate together on an international scale. 

# Internet of things (IOT)
Connecting manual physical things to the internet and making them smarter.

# Coding 
Translation of one language to another.

# Scripting
Coding in a scripting language for limited range tasks.

# Programming

# Software
Refers to something that was programmed. 

# Types of software
Application Software: Any software created to fulfill a specific need, like a test editor, web browser, or graphic editor.
System Software: Software used to keep our core system running, like operating system tools and utilities.
Firmware: Permanently stored on a computer component.
Software versions: Tell us which features were added to a specific piece of software.

# Recipe for computing
Assembly language: human readable instructions to create binary code. 

# Compiled programming language
Takes human language and compiles them into machine language.

# Interpreted language
Script Run by an interpreter which interprets the code into cpu instructions just in time to run them.
Lets you harness the power of a computer to perform task on you behalf.

# Managing software
Drivers: allow us to interact with our hardware.
Applications: Day to day job function.
Utilities: Settings, calculators

# Git
Version control system that helps keep track of changes made to files nad directories.

# Software automation
Having software do things automatically.

# The user layer
Analyze the issue

Then try a re-install

# What to avoid
