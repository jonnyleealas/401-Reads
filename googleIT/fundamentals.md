# History of technology
Analytical engine Lovelace figured out that we could program algorithms into it.
Cryptography: writing and solving codes. Crititcal to computer security.
Allen Turing: enigma machine, potentail of computation. 
Punch cards were the first way to store data and process data. 
That led to magnetic tape. They can store data and run data on a machine.
Computers use to have vacuum tube and the tubes would break all the time. 
The term bug comes from finding a butterfly in the tubes after trying to figure out why the hardware had a problem in the relay. 
ENIAC(one of the first computer with tubes)
Later transistors were used instead of tubes. 
Admoirla Grace hoppe: Transliated human language via programming language into machine code. This was a huge milestone in programming. We didn't need to write machine code in 1 and 0
s.
Hard disk drives and micro processors. Xerox was the first computer that ressebled what we use today. Only used in military or university at the time.
Apple one was the first computer created for hobbiest. 
Windows was the first operating system to be able to be used with any hardware. IT was used to support technology.
Unix was an operating system.
OS means Operating System.
Open source means it is not owned by a single company. 
Linux is an open source operating system.
Pda personal digital assistants.

# IT
It extends the thinking range of not only individuals but or organizations. Data can be processed faster and decisions can be made more accurately. Mental power to process data can now be transferred over to hardware and software to do the job. Future decisions can be based on data and not human observations which takes more time and energy. 
IT allows for fewer people to do more work. IT allows us to avoid communications errors and misconception of goals.
The need to find odd ball creatives that usually go un-noticed will be more of a focus. These individuals will be important in the steps to improve IT.
Thinkers and Creatives will be more on level of top management.


# OSI --->>> Open Systems Interconnection
This is a 7 layers that computers use to communicate over a network.
7) Application Layer -> Used by end user -> browser and emails.
6) Presentation Layer -> Sends application layer data and prepares it for session layer.
5) Session Layer -> Opens Communication/sessions for devices.
4) Transport Layer -> Segments/reassembles session layer data. Checks for errors/ matches rate speed.
3) Network Layer -> Segments into network packets, routes packets across best physical network path.
2) Data Link Layer -> Establishes and terminates connections between physically connected nodes.
1) Physical Layer -> Cables, wireless connection. Transmits raw data(1s 0s) and bit rate control.

# Kernel
Connects system hardware with application software. In computing the kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computer's operating system, with complete control over everything in the system. The kernel is often one of the first programs loaded up on start-up before the boot loader. The kernel manages the hardware resources that the software uses.

# Activity Monitor(mac)/ Task Manager(windows)
If you want to see where your cpu or ram resources are being allocated you can check the activity monitor.

# Remote
Another location for your repository to exist. When we use git remote origin --> origin is really what ever we want to call it. Instead of origin we can say something like (git remote platapus -->)
