# History of technology
Analytical engine Lovelace figured out that we could program algorithms into it.
Cryptography: writing and solving codes. Crititcal to computer security.
Allen Turing: enigma machine, potentail of computation. 
Punch cards were the first way to store data and process data. 
That led to magnetic tape. They can store data and run data on a machine.
Computers use to have vacuum tube and the tubes would break all the time. 
The term bug comes from finding a butterfly in the tubes after trying to figure out why the hardware had a problem in the relay. 
ENIAC(one of the first computer with tubes)
Later transistors were used instead of tubes. 
Admoirla Grace hoppe: Transliated human language via programming language into machine code. This was a huge milestone in programming. We didn't need to write machine code in 1 and 0
s.
Hard disk drives and micro processors. Xerox was the first computer that ressebled what we use today. Only used in military or university at the time.
Apple one was the first computer created for hobbiest. 
Windows was the first operating system to be able to be used with any hardware. IT was used to support technology.
Unix was an operating system.
OS means Operating System.
Open source means it is not owned by a single company. 
Linux is an open source operating system.
Pda personal digital assistants.

# IT
It extends the thinking range of not only individuals but or organizations. Data can be processed faster and decisions can be made more accurately. Mental power to process data can now be transferred over to hardware and software to do the job.
