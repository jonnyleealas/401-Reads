Ports: Connection points that we can connect devices to that extend the functionality of our computers.
cpu: central processing unit. Calculates and processess data.
ram: short term memory. stores temporary data.
hard drive: holds long term data. 
Motherboard: Lets components communicate with each other. The body that connects all components to each other.
Power Supply: converts wall electricity to energy that the hardware can use.

# Translates info into instructions using programs.
Instructions for the computer and what it needs to do. Programs send instructions to the cpu for processing. Anything that can't be processed fast enough is saved in ram for later processing. Our cpu can then accessing data inside the ram instead of the program in a faster more efficient way.
External data bus: Wires that interconnect the parts in our computer. Like veins in the body. A voltage sent through the edb is a 1 in binary. If a voltage is not sent then it is read as 0. 8 16 64 bits.
Registers: Lets us store data that our cpu works with. 
Memory controller chip MCC: Bridge between cpu and ram. Cpu talks to the MCC and makes a request. MCC finds the data in the ram and sends it through the edb.
Address Bus: Connects the cpu to the mcc. and sends location to the data. mcc takes address and looks for the data. Data is then sent over to ebd.
Cache: Faster than ram and smaller. It stores data we use often to quickly reference. 
L1 : smallest and fastest cache
L2 :
L3 :
Clock Wire: Tells cpu when instructions ends and begins. Every tick the cpu does one cycle of operations or clock cycles.
3.4gigahertz means maximum cycles a cpu can handle. 3.4 billion.
Overclocking: increases rate of cpu clock cycles to preform more tasks.
Cpu: The brain of our computer.
INstructions sets: Hard coded chips that run specifics commands. A cpu must be compatible with your motherboard. They fit together with sockets.
A cpu must have a heat sink to dissipate heat from our cpu to keep cool. 
32 vs 64 cpu: Specify how much data it can efficiently handle.
Ram stores data that we can access quickly. Ram is cleared once we shut down our machine. Ram makes copies of our programs so our cpu can process.
Ram allows us to run multiple programs at the same time.
DRAM: Dynamic random access memory. Each bit is stored in a microscopic capacitor. These semiconductors are placed on chips that are on the ram and store our data.
SDRAM: Synchronous 
DDRAM: Double and Faster with larger capacity shor term memory
