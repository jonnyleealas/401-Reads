1. Tell me about a time when you could not meet the deadline of a project.
I had to turn in a todo application in two weeks. On the second week we had a snow storm that took our power. There wasn't way to charge our computers and the whole we used our time to find food, water, and heat. I communicated to the team about the project and the situation i was dealing with. They extended the deadline. What I learned was that random things happen and it much better to communicate with your team than to freak out. Usually communication can help move things along and sometimes its not as bad as things seem.

2. What do you do when you need to motivate a group of individuals?
I usually am always looking for clues in peoples energy or what they are saying. Ill ask how people they are doing, make a joke to raise energy levels or change things up, I'll then ask what concerns they may have, or what they would love to see in the task or project, what role would they like to take on. Breaks are helpful sometimes to restart the brain. Sometimes Ill even start the meeting with a song to change things up. It depends on how the group is feeling and the message they are sending through words or body language. Depending on a few things I have a few things up my sleeve to try and ignite some energy. Would you like to give me scenario to test how I would deal with the situation.

3. A time when you were faced with a problem that had multiple solutions.
We were working on a project and the group having difficulty deciding which frame work to try. We were deciding between gastby which we had previously used and next which we would have to learn how to use. Our deadline for the project was one week. We all decided to try and implement next. After two days we found out that next was a bit more work than we had thought, so I suggested we start from scratch and go back to gatsby. We ended up finishing the project, but it wasn't done smoothly. I learned that it is probably best to stick with what you know if you don't have a lot of time to finish something. Experimentation should probably be done outside the scope of a deadline. I also know this from being in a band. Every time we tried adding a new song to a live show that we hadn't practiced it was a disaster. We later made a rule to only play songs we had practiced and only improvise with songs we knew by heart. 

4. Lets say you need something from a coworker and that person isn't responding. How would you deal with this?
With a situation like this I take two different approaches. If I don't know the person well enough I'll talk to someone who knows them a bit better and ask them how that person likes to communicate. Then I will go from there and try to communicate with them. If I know the person or their type of personality then I just ask them if we can schedule a time to speak one on one. Usually a one on one conversation to understand their point of view is all it takes to get someone to open up.

5. Tell me about a time when you worked with a difficult team member?
I feel like anytime I work with someone who seems a bit difficult things get better the more you listen to them. Ill ask questions about their interests. I'll ask about what they enjoy or don't enjoy about work or the project. I ask sometimes even ask if I have done something or someone else has done something that bothered them. Usually once they start opening up and they see that all you want to do is listen, they start being more open to working with you.

6. An example when you needed to push back on a decision.
I've been the new guy most of my life lol. Usually what I do is try to learn as much as I can from how they do things at my new place. Ill introduce myself to people and try my best not to invade anyone's space. I first learn how I can be part of the team, how the team does things, learn about my new coworkers, and then after I have a good read on things I'll feel more comfortable showing more of myself. I really like to mold myself to my surroundings rather than impose. I like to learn how the company does things and what it expects. 

7. Tell me about an interesting project and how you kept things moving.
We were working on a store app based on buy nothing.
Well we came up with an out line of the project. How many days we had and the things that needed to get done. Each day we would meet for a few minutes in the morning and then a few minutes at the end of the day. Communication was open throughout the day ucing slack. One thing I added to the meetings was to just hang for a bit without talking about work. Maybe 5 minutes or so with the team. To talk about how their morning was, or did they see the game, or just random things. I always felt the starting the morning on a light note gave everyone a better mood to then start getting down to business. 

8. Toughest decision you've had to make in the passed 6 months. 
Having to visit my family in an emergency. My dad was going through some mental issues and I was having to decide of whether to wait it out to see if things improve or decide to go an see if I can help in person. The reason it was difficulty is because I wasn't ina place financially to take a trip to california for a week. I decided to just buy a ticket and go, and that this was the right thing to do. It turned out to be such a good trip. I was able to help him and also the trip helped me get closer to my mother and the rest of my family.

9. 3 strengths
I am great with people and working with all types of personalities.
I am very reliable
I deep dive into anything I am trying to get good at. It consumes me. For instance I was trying to learn to make smash burgers. So for 2 weeks straight I made smash burgers everyday till I was able to make burgers taste good enough to where I was ok to letting other taste them.

A weakness is that I deep dive into things and anything I get interested it I tend to deep dive. Although getting good at something or learning about something is good, I need to find a way to shut that part of my brain off sometimes. Recently I bought a mechanical keyboard. That led me to spend 8 hours one day lubing the switches. I am not ever again spending 8 hours on anything that has to do with keyboard switch lubing lol.

Sometimes I analyze things that don't need to be analyzed. I have built a habit over the years of breaking things down and figuring out why things happen in life. However that sometimes makes me miss what is actually happening in front of me in real time. I need to shut that off and live in the moment and be present. I am working on that. This year I've started learning to meditate for 5 minutes in when I wake up and 5 ;minutes before I go to sleep. I feel that has helped shut my brain off from constantly looping through things when I don't have to. 

Another weakness of mine is that as social as I am I am also a bit of an introvert once my energy gets drained from socializing. Because of this I find that I need to take 10 minute breaks if I am around big crowds for too many hours. Like I can be the life of the party and talk to everyone in the room, but every now and then I find that I just need to be by myself for a sec to recharge. 

Also I am still learning to be a better listener. Its taken a while for me to listen first and the speak when in conversations with people. I should always be focused on the person I am speaking with and what they are saying, but sometimes I find that I still jump the gun before they are finished. 

Also my sleeping habits are terrible. I go to sleep way too late sometimes. I've been working on that and I am better and shutting off electronics before going to bed but I still get sucked in.

10. Why do you want to work at google?
I am always looking to improve as a person. Whether in confidence, the way i think, or how I treat others. I read a new york times article on googles project aristotle. I can't recall everything in the article but what I took from it I use in my day to day life. The first being let every one speak equally and to have sensitivity to the group you're in. This article allowed me to see how google views team work and how it tries to improve ad learn about team work and productivity. I want to be part of this company not only because google is everything technology and internet, but also I love how much they are always looking to improve in all areas. I want to learn how to be a better problem solver and there isn't a better place in my opinion learn about problem solving than google. 

11. Dealing with a conflict with a team member in the passed?
I had an argument with a team mate once. I told her during the argument that I was frustrated with the situation allow me to cool my head. After I had called down I apologized for allowing my emotions to get flustered and then explained why I was frustrated. I also asked her how I frustrated her and tried to find out where communication had failed. 

12. Tell me about a time when you missed an obvious solution to a problem.
To be honest I feel like do that all the time when writing code. Sometimes I'll get stuck on something and then when I find a solution I find that I was over complicating things. I'm still learning how to simplify things and that a lot of problems don't need a complicated solution.

13. Tell me about a time where you took the lead on a difficult project.
I was a bartender at red robin a few years ago. The power went down and computers shut down. Once of my managers panicked and went home. We were left without leadership, hungry customers, and customers who wanted to pay and leave. First thing I did wasalk to the rest of the team and let them know that our manager left. Next I spoke to the front desk and told them to let new customers know that our computers were down for the forseeable future. I told the servers to let the customers waiting for food that we may have to retake orders because some orders didn't go through due to the power outage. And the customers who wanted to leave we either took cash or gave them the option to leave their number to pay later, or the food was on the house.

14. A time where you came up with a new approach to a problem.
So recently we had a water and power outage in texas. We didn't have heat or water to use bathrooms. I noticed that ice would melt from the roof during the day time. I put pots and pans all around the house to catch those droplets and used that water to fill the toilets. For heat, we needed wood, but wood was sold out. I previously worked for walmart and knew that they threw away wood palets. We took those unwanted palets from the back and used them for wood fire. 

15. Describe a time when you found it difficult to work with someone form a different background.
There's was a from class who would always get frustrated with everything and everyone. He would shut everyone's ideas down and not let anyone speak. I was paired up with him one on one so I took the time to get to know him. Once I felt he was open to hearing constructive criticism I explained to him how we felt he was treating us

16. Tell me about a time you had to deal with ambiguity.
When I was a teenager I went on a mission trip to mexico. When I was there I received a call from home saying my mom had left california and had taken my little sister with her. What that meant was that I was now homeless. I came back home to a borded up house. I called an older cousin of mine who allowed me to stay with her for a while. She found a place for me to stay, that lasted for two weeks before they asked me to leave because they were gonna have another family take the room i was in. Basically for a few months I was hoping from house to house lookig for places to stay. Or I would sleep in my car. Later the mother of a friend of mine offered a room for me to stay in if I paid rent. That whole time was filled with confusion for me. All I had was a duffle and my 1988 sentra. What I learned from that is to keep moving and take every door that is open for you. I also learned that having a network of friends can mean the difference in life sometimes. 

17. Tell me about a time when you made sure a customer was pleased with your service.
An elderly couple came in to the restaurant one time and they complained about the table they were given. They felt that they had been type cast and were given that table do to their age. They felt that was rude and also unfair. I explained that the reason they were given that section in the restaurant was because we didn't have servers in other areas. I also asked them to give me the opportunity to serve them and to change their experience. I moved them to a section in the restaurant where they felt most comfortable. They thanked me through out their meal for attending to them. Later I left them my name and told them any time they were un happy during another visit to have the staff contact me and i would help them figure out how to best meet their needs.

18. Dealing with a difficult customer.
There was a guest who had alcohol in a bag and was drinking from it at the bar top. He was also bothering some of the waitresses. I kindly asked him if he was drinking alcohol from inside his bag. He said no. Then I told him , " look I have to be honest, ive been watching you for a while and I've seen you take beer cans out of the bag and drink from them. We can't have that. Plus we are closed now. Per the law of the state of washington I have to ask you to leave, because we can't have outside drinks in the restaurant." He wasn't too happy about what I said. He kinda wanted to fight me. However, I had to do what I had to do and had a manger help me as we both walked him out. 

19. Describe a time you improved a process with limited budget.

20. Tell me about a team project you worked on.

21. Tell me about a situation where you had to solve a difficult problem.

22. Why google? Give three reasons.
I feel I can make a difference here and be someone valuable to google. I have a lot of life experiences that I feel can be helpful to google. I was homeless, my mom and dad both left me as a child and i was raised by my uncle. My mother is a lesbian so I also have lived in an lgbt house hold. Ive been to more than 15 school, and lived in a third world country. I've been a musician, toured the country, and played for thousands of people. I feel I have a lot I can share with google and way more to learn from google. 
Lastly, There isn't a better place to learn about technology than google. If I have to be a janitor here just to get the foot in the door ill do it. Where's the mop?
